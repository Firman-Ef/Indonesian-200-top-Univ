# Indonesian-2022-top-University-by-UniRank

### What are the most popular Universities in Indonesia? uniRank tries to answer this question by publishing the 2022 Indonesian University Ranking of 578 Indonesian higher-education institutions meeting the following uniRank selection criteria:

being chartered, licensed, or accredited by the appropriate Indonesian higher education-related organization

offering at least four-year undergraduate degrees (bachelor's degrees) or postgraduate degrees (master's or doctoral degrees)
delivering courses predominantly in a traditional, face-to-face, non-distance education format
Aiming is to provide a non-academic League Table of the top Indonesian Universities based on valid, unbiased, and non-influenceable web metrics provided by independent web intelligence sources rather than data submitted by the Universities themselves.
